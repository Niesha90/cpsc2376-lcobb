First bug was the for (int i = start; i < end; i++) corrected to for (int i = start; i <= end; i++) {

Second bug found was the for (size_t i = 0; i <= numbers.size(); i++) Fixed the loop  for (int i = start; i <= end; i++)

Third bug  if (numbers[i] > 0) { corrected if (numbers[i] < 0)  Fixed the logic for the negative numbers 


Fourth bug if (numbers.empty()) return 0; corrected with  return std::numeric_limits<int>::min();

Fifth Bug for (size_t i = 1; i <= numbers.size(); i++) correction for (size_t i = 1; i < numbers.size(); i++)

Sixth Bug  if (numbers[i] >= maxVal) { // Bug corrected with  if (numbers[i] > maxVal) {
